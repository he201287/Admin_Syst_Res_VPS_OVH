Subject: fetchmail authentication failed on contact1@mail.wt1.ephec-ti.be
Message-Id: <20170515140406.4AE3E5E1BAB@mail.wt1.ephec-ti.be>


Fetchmail could not get mail from contact1@mail.wt1.ephec-ti.be.

The attempt to get authorization failed.
This probably means your password is invalid, but some servers have
other failure modes that fetchmail cannot distinguish from this
because they don't send useful error messages on login failure.

The fetchmail daemon will continue running and attempt to connect
at each cycle.  No future notifications will be sent until service
is restored.
